\section{Plot}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Introduction \& Omissions}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Introduce the concept as Beowulf as an epic, and explain why I missed out lots of
stuff that is interesting but not central to the plot. 

\subsection{Act 1: Grendel}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The poem opens with a story about Scyld Shefing, founder of the royal house
of the Spear-Danes, of which \textit{Hrothgar} is a member. \textit{The Bard} 
goes through much of the back story of the Syclding dynasty, the building of Heorot
and introduces Grendel and Beowulf before the play proper begins.

The introduction is taken almost verbatim from the poem, merely missing out sections
for brevity; such as the passage describing Scyld's burial.

The play itself opens with \textit{Beowulf's} arrival at Heorot (his departure
from Geatland and subsequent arrival in Denmark having been narrated, while his
conversation with the lookout has been omitted). 

\subsection{Act 2: Grendel's Mother}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Beowulf kills Grendel's Mother.

\subsection{Act 3: The Dragon}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Beowulf kills the dragon, but in the process is himself killed.

Yay Alexander translation. I basically shortened it and removed some of the more
flowery language.
